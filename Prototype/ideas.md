# Ideasï¼š
- traditional controller
- magnitude & duration

the idea is similar to the pinoeer sensing to get knowledge to properly setup the thresholds for magnitude and duration
# environment-aware control framework - know the environment first then control; to tackle with the unseen events, plus human knowledge

Part 1:
Sense All and Clustering - threshold
- extant classes
- new classes

Part 2:
Check whether the event is interested or not  - (1) criterions (2) known classes

Part 3:
based on the context 

# Notes:
- conventional optimization methods
  - optimal threshold, duration
- Dr Meng Dataset 

- measurement error

- Xnode GPR
