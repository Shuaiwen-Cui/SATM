Smart Adaptive Triggering Mechanism for Vibration-based SHM

Brief: This project aims to achieve automatic fine tune of triggering parameters for wireless vibration sensors. The first part is for data simulation, the second is for AI classifier, and the third will be the controller for closed-loop feedback control.(for now, only the first part is uploaded)
